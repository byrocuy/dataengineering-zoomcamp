# Week 1: Conterization and Infrastructure as a Code

This is the notes for week 1 of the course [Data Engineering Zoomcamp](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/data-engineering-zoomcamp/). You can find the code, steps and some explanation for the week 1 materials. At the end of the notes, you can find some [errors I encountered and the solutions](#some-errors-i-encountered-and-the-solutions) that maybe helps if you encounter the same errors.
